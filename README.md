# Frontend interview task

The idea behind this task is to check how you approach day to day frontend development tasks. We think it's more indicative of whether you will be a right fit for our team than performing a regular questions/answers interview. The task simulates a real case scenario of things you might be faced with when working at Datastory. It's simplified to be possible to accomplish in a short amount of time, we estimate it should take between 1-2h.

## Objective

The task is specified inside an issue, like we do in our day to day work. The issue should contain all instructions and materials needed to solve it. If you feel something is missing or unclear then please use your best judgement to decide what to do. You need to branch out of `main`, perform the work at hand and then open a PR. When collaborating remotely/async written explanations are crucial that's why it's very important to provide as detailed explanation in the PR about what you did, what you didn't and why.

## Repo structure
